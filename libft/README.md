# libft @ 42

This is the first 42 project. The task is to recreate various standard C library functions, as well as extra functions which might be useful such as functions to deal with linked lists.

## Compiling
You may compile a `libft.a` by running `make`.

## Usage
Include it in your C project:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```

## A little note for 42 students
Hello! Please don't steal this code, or the bocalians might eat you! If you have any troubles, feel free to ask me on Slack or e-mail. I was blocked on a bus error for a while ([see intra topic](https://forum.intra.42.fr/topics/4384/messages)), and I still don't know what was causing it! I recoded most of part 1 functions and now it passes with all bonuses :)!

Good luck, and thanks for all the fish!
